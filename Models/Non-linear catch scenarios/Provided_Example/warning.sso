Note 1 Information: Max data length bin: 90  < max pop len bins: 94; so will accumulate larger pop len bins
Note 2 Information: Std_yrmax=-1 in starter, so no variance output for forecast quantities after endyr+1 
Note 3 Suggestion: This model has just one settlement event. Changing to recr_dist_method 4 and removing the recruitment distribution parameters at the end of the MG parms section (below growth parameters) will produce identical results and simplify the model.
Warning 1 : 1st iteration warning: ssb(endyr)/ssb(styr)= 0.000988751; suggest start with larger R0 to get near 0.4; or use depletion fleet option
Warning 2 : Main recdev biasadj is >2 times ratio of rmse to sigmaR
Note 4 Information:  N parameters that are on or within 1% of min-max bound: 1; check results, variance may be suspect
 2 warnings  and 4 notes
