Note 1 Suggestion: This model has just one settlement event. Changing to recr_dist_method 4 and removing the recruitment distribution parameters at the end of the MG parms section (below growth parameters) will produce identical results and simplify the model.
Warning 1 Adjustment: Adjusting recdev_early to: 5
Note 2 Suggestion: Are you sure you want so few early recrdevs? Better to include in range of main recdevs 1
Note 3 Information: A revised protocol for the Fcast_yr specification is available and recommended.
